      <p>A chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs.[1] They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for short distance. Some sleep in trees if there are trees around.
      A male chicken is called a rooster or a cock (short for cockerel). A female chicken is called a hen. A young chicken is called a chick. Like other female birds, hens lay eggs. The eggs hatch into chicks.
      When raising chickens, a farmer needs to build a chicken coop (like a little house) for the chickens to roost (sleep) in. They also need a run or yard where they can exercise, take dust baths, eat, and drink. The chickens also need to be protected from predators such as foxes. Fences are often used for this. [2]
    Chickens can also be farmed intensively. This lets farms make a lot of chicken meat and eggs. This is not as good for the chickens.</p>
    <p>Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.</p>

      <p>Meat from a cow one year old or older, but generally 18 to 24 months. In the U.S. the USDA grades beef according to proportion of beef to bone, beef to fat and quality. In order of best to worst the grades of beef stamped on the meat in harmless purple vegetable dye are: Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner.</p>
      <p>Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[4] In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.</p>
      <p>vaporation concentrates the remaining proteins and increases flavor intensity; the molds can contribute a nut-like flavor. After two to three days there are significant effects. The majority of the tenderizing effect occurs in the first 10 days. Boxed beef, stored and distributed in vacuum packaging, is, in effect, wet aged during distribution. Premium steakhouses dry age for 21 to 28 days or wet age up to 45 days for maximum effect on flavor and tenderness.</p>

      <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨) is a Japanese dish of specially prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯 sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, combined with a variety of ingredients (ネタ neta), such as seafood (most commonly and often raw), vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯). The term sushi is no longer used in its original context and literally means "sour-tasting"

Sushi can be prepared with brown rice, but traditionally it is made with medium grain white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients such as calamari, eel, and imitation crab meat. Many others are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi (or horseradish paste), and soy sauce (or tamari). Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.</p>
